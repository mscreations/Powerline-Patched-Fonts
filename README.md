Powerline Patched Fonts
=======================

This repository contains patched copies of monospace fonts to include the Powerline icons (both old and new code locations). It also is patched to properly display NERDTree in VIM when NERDTreeDirArrows is set to 1. 

Included fonts:
---------------

Liberation Mono Powerline

If you use these fonts and find that they do not display a character you expect it to, please create and issue and be sure to include the Unicode code location as well as what you are expecting to see and I will try to pach it.
